# Learn Kubernetes 

This repo contains configuration files for deploying the toy [SynergyChat](https://github.com/bootdotdev/synergychat) application from Boot.dev's [Learn Kubernetes](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-kubernetes) lesson.

I did several further practices besides the local Minikube cluster approach guided by the lessons. I discuss the different approaches and their network architecture in this [post](https://lywgit.github.io/posts/2025-11-25-k8s-note/) (written in Chinese).
